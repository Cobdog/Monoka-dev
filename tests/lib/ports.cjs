/** Disjoint per-suite port ranges for the vitest era (task z7ogmig,
 * 2026-09-20).
 *
 * The cjs suites each probed a RANDOM port inside a suite-local range —
 * but the ranges OVERLAPPED (storage/filmstrip/realtime/documents all
 * shared 4400–4849; llm/datasets shared 4850–5149), which was safe only
 * because run-gate.cjs ran them strictly serially. Under vitest's
 * parallel file workers a probe-then-bind race between two suites picking
 * the same port becomes real, so each test file now draws from its OWN
 * disjoint range. Every allocation is still probe-verified before use
 * (something on this box squats on 4321; a busy candidate is skipped,
 * never killed — the shared-box discipline) and never handed out twice
 * within a process.
 *
 * Ranges deliberately avoid: 4178/4199 (launcher default + e2e webServer),
 * 4321 (box squatter), 5173 (vite dev), the other agents' assigned ranges
 * (5300–7199 except the launcher's historical 7000–7099 which this suite
 * keeps), 7300–7399 (this suite family's own agent range), and
 * 8188/8189/8191+ (engine — NEVER). */
