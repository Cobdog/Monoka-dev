# The load-bearing assumption register — ratify-and-verify pass 1

> **Provenance.** Commissioned by maintainer directive `6a857386` (epic 4lphxv8, 2026-09-21): *"ratify and verify critical assumptions we have made in other documentation. Not EVERYTHING, but things that if we get wrong will force us to pivot on the fly or lead to surprises."* Sparked by the YuE2 agent self-catching a wrong "Music 3 is API-only" claim. This file is pass 1 and the TEMPLATE the recurring spot-checks update (recurrence: after major research landings, before spec rounds, on any self-caught wrong claim).
> **Method.** Every row verified against primary sources 2026-09-21: in-repo code reads (read-only), the canonical shared install `/home/agent/comfyui` (v0.34.0 @ `a87667f` — read-only, nothing run), upstream ComfyUI tags + master via raw.githubusercontent + the GitHub API, the HF model API, the npm registry, and web search for the two platform facts. No GPU, no engine boots, no installs. Verdicts: **VERIFIED** (evidence cited) · **CORRECTED** (dated addendum patched into the source doc — never silent replacement) · **UNVERIFIABLE-NOW** (the cheap settling test named).
> **Scope discipline.** Pivot-forcing tier only. Sweep sources: `docs/audit/remediation-plan.md` (§1–§6), `docs/devdocs/` (MANIFEST + both captures + divergence sections), the 2026-09-20/21 research assessments (qwen-image-2.1, h3-image-studio-pack, node-pack-registry, ui-systems-design-language, shibui-fonts-icons, crossview-warp, yue2-3b), the epic directive facts, `docs/ROADMAP.md` + `docs/LEARNINGS.md`.

## 0. Headline

**24 rows: 3 CORRECTED (2 patched in-pass), 18 VERIFIED, 3 UNVERIFIABLE-NOW.** The trigger item (Music 3 API-only) was already self-corrected in the YuE2 doc and verifies as correct. The real cluster this pass found is **version-pin drift**: upstream tagged three releases in 15 days (v0.35.0 Sep 9, v0.36.0 Sep 15, **v0.37.0 today**), and two of our newest family gates quote wrong or stale minimums (CORRECTED rows 2–3). The good news: every captured engine-contract semantic was re-verified UNCHANGED from v0.34.0 through master — the app's integration surface is stable; only the node-inventory surface (which families exist where) moved. Policy recommendation in §2.

| # | The assumption | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Music 3 delivery = open weights, local, API closed to new users | **VERIFIED** (the self-correction holds) |
| 2 | YuE2 native nodes require "ComfyUI ≥ v0.35.0" (docs.comfy.org, quoted into our assessment) | **CORRECTED** — nodes first ship **v0.36.0**; `cfg_scale` needs v0.37.0+ |
| 3 | Qwen-Image-2.1 native nodes "require master/nightly or the next tagged release" | **CORRECTED** — that release exists now: **v0.37.0** (tagged 2026-09-21) |

## 1. The register

### A. Version-pin drift (the cluster this pass exists to catch)

| ID | Assumption (as currently recorded) | Verdict | Evidence (all fetched 2026-09-21) | Decision it shapes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-1 | Our engine reference + schema fixtures pin v0.34.0 (`a87667f`); upstream releases v0.35.0 (Sep 9), v0.36.0 (Sep 15), v0.37.0 (Sep 21 — today); master pyproject = 0.37.0 | **VERIFIED** — the drift itself is real and faster than the capture cadence assumed | `pyproject.toml`/`comfyui_version.py` at master = 0.37.0; tag dates via github.com/releases; shared install `cat comfyui_version.py` = 0.34.0 + `git log -1` = `a87667f` | The re-capture policy (§2) and every "instance bump" precondition in the new-family tasks |
| A-2 | Captured API semantics hold at master (maintainer's runtime), not just at the 0.34.0 pin — checked: no `/refresh` route; `/object_info/{node}` unknown → `200 {}`; terminal events = `execution_success`/`_error`/`_interrupted` (no null-node `executing`); typed-scalar min/max validation (`value_smaller_than_min`); `MAXIMUM_HISTORY_SIZE` eviction; tqdm `progress` hijack in `main.py`; WS first-message feature negotiation; `/experiment/models`; `/api/jobs` | **VERIFIED — UNCHANGED 0.34.0 → master on every checked surface** | Shared-install greps + master raw fetches of `server.py`, `execution.py`, `main.py`, `app/model_manager.py` (e.g. master `execution.py:824` `execution_success`; master route list has no `/refresh`; `MAXIMUM_HISTORY_SIZE = 10000` at `execution.py:1291`) | The app's integration floor can stay "≥0.34.0 semantics" with confidence; no forced app-side change from upstream motion |
| A-3 | YuE2 native nodes require "v0.35.0+" (docs.comfy.org, quoted in `yue2-3b-assessment.md` §4) | **CORRECTED** — `comfy_extras/nodes_yue2.py` is **absent from v0.35.0, v0.35.1, v0.35.2** (raw fetch 404; zero YuE classes anywhere at those tags — the only "yue" hit is the Cantonese language code in `nodes_ace.py`) and **first ships in v0.36.0**; the `cfg_scale` input exists only at v0.37.0/master (commit #16373, 09-17, post-v0.36.0-tag) | Raw file checks per tag + class grep; docs.comfy.org states "v0.35.0 or later is required" — the site is wrong against its own tags, and we inherited the number | The audio-adoption instance-bump precondition: bumping to "v0.35.0 as documented" would still 404 YuE2. Patched as a dated addendum in `docs/devdocs/comfyui-api/index.md`; the YuE2 doc is owned in-flight — coordinator relays to the audio agent |
| A-4 | Qwen-Image-2.1 native nodes "not in the v0.36.0 tag; requires master/nightly or the next tagged release" (`qwen-image-2.1-assessment.md` §3, written release-day) | **CORRECTED (stale by one release, in the predicted direction)** — **v0.37.0 (2026-09-21) is the first tagged release carrying `QwenImage21`** (6 occurrences in v0.37.0 `nodes_qwen.py`; zero in v0.35.x/v0.36.0). The doc's own revisit trigger ("first tagged ComfyUI release carrying #16400") has fired | Per-tag raw fetches of `comfy_extras/nodes_qwen.py` | Family-registry timing for the Workbench's qwen-edit lane; one instance bump to v0.37.0+ now unblocks BOTH new families. Dated addendum patched into the assessment |
| A-5 | The maintainer's own instance (8188, off-limits) runs latest master — i.e. ≈ v0.37.0 today — while the shared install + testbed base sit at v0.34.0 | **UNVERIFIABLE-NOW (by policy — 8188 is never probed)**; recorded as the standing reason captures pinned at 0.34.0 may under-describe the maintainer's runtime | Project CLAUDE.md states the instance runs latest master; cheap settling test: ask the maintainer, or read their launcher log with permission | The app must keep probing rather than assuming (the registry-only + object_info-probe design already does); the shared-install bump decision (§2) |

### B. The trigger item — Music 3 delivery

| ID | Assumption | Verdict | Evidence | Decision it shapes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-1 | Music 3 = **open weights, generated locally** (the YuE2 doc's Part II §8 correction of the inherited "API-only" label) | **VERIFIED** — HF `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Music3`: ungated, repo created 2026-08-07, LICENSE file = "MiniMax Music3 COMMUNITY LICENSE" (12.2k downloads); stock core nodes `MiniMaxMusic3TextEncode` + `EmptyMiniMaxMusic3LatentAudio` exist at the shared install 0.34.0 (`comfy_extras/nodes_minimax_music.py:10,44`) AND unchanged at master; our dock builds locally (`src/lib/music3Workflow.ts`: UNETLoader → TextEncode → KSampler → tiled VAE decode) | HF model API + raw LICENSE head, 2026-09-21; shared-install + master code reads | The paused-audio-lane rebalance (music3 stays a fallback-ladder rung, zero new integration debt) |
| B-2 | MiniMax's paid music API closed to new users 2026-08-20 (open weights = the only forward lane) | **VERIFIED** | Platform docs via search (secondary corroboration: [minimax-ai.chat](https://minimax-ai.chat) citing platform.minimax.io, "August 20, 2026: paid Music Generation and Lyrics Generation APIs are no longer available to new users") | Whether any music3 "API mode" is ever worth building — no |
| B-3 | No OTHER doc embeds the wrong "API-only" characterization | **VERIFIED** — repo-wide grep: the only "API-only" hit is fal's H3 Max (a different model, correctly labeled); `ecosystem-2026-09.md` lane 5 already says "open weights, Aug 13 2026" | grep -rn over docs/, 2026-09-21 | None — the wrong claim lived only in the YuE2 first draft and is already corrected there |

### C. Engine-contract facts (the devdocs captures — re-verified at both revisions)

| ID | Assumption | Verdict | Evidence | Decision it shapes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | No `/refresh` route at the pinned revision (capture addendum 2026-09-20); the studio's Refresh = best-effort POST + mandatory re-fetch | **VERIFIED** at 0.34.0 (grep of `server.py`/`main.py`/`app/`/`api_server/` — zero route hits) **and still at master** (master route list re-enumerated: no `/refresh`) | Shared-install grep + master `server.py` route enumeration, 2026-09-21 | R-12's refresh affordance stays as built; the best-effort POST starts doing real work for free if upstream ever ships the route |
| C-2 | `/object_info/{node}` unknown node → HTTP 200 `{}`; absence = key-miss, never status | **VERIFIED** at 0.34.0 (`server.py:813-819`) and master (`server.py:816-817`, same handler body) | Code reads both revisions | A-8 incremental pulls + the F6 preflight diff (live in Wave 1/2) |
| C-3 | Terminal-signal contract: completion is `execution_success` (never a null-node `executing`) | **VERIFIED** at 0.34.0 (`execution.py:824`) and master (`execution.py:824`) | Code reads both revisions | `realtime.ts` job-done derivation — contract-correct, stays |
| C-4 | H3 still-image `length` floor is server-side, twice (schema min at validation + `align_frame_count(max(5,·))` grid-snap at execution) — T=1 impossible on stock nodes; tiers 9/13 snap to 22 | **VERIFIED** at 0.34.0 (`execution.py` `value_smaller_than_min`; `nodes_minimax_h3.py` `temporal_shape`) **and UNCHANGED at master** (same lines fetched 2026-09-21) | Code reads both revisions; also enforced in CI by the engine-contract real-schema gate (PR #39) | The `h3img.generate.t1` family's known-broken-against-stock status; the Image-Studio adoption task (`afvlbk4`) or first-party port remains the only fix; packet-tier 9/13 repricing |
| C-5 | ComfyUI-Manager absent on the shared install (pip pin `4.2.2` present, package not installed, no `--enable-manager`) — presence must be probed | **VERIFIED** — `manager_requirements.txt` = `comfyui_manager==4.2.2`; site-packages contains `comfyui_embedded_docs`/`comfyui_frontend_package`/`comfyui_workflow_templates` but **no `comfyui_manager`** | Shared-install reads, 2026-09-21 | The Manager-first install build (still pending, registry doc correction #3) will probe "absent" there and fall back to our fetcher |
| C-6 | Manager 4.3 (tag 2026-09-18) remains undiffed — the capture's verify-on trigger | **UNVERIFIABLE-NOW** (GitHub API rate-limited late in this pass; not load-bearing until the Manager-first build) — cheap settling test: read `comfyui_manager/glob/manager_server.py` at tag 4.3 and diff the route table + `QueueTaskItem` vs the capture §1 (~30 min, no engine) | — | Whether the Wave-2-style Manager-first recipe needs adjusting before that build |

### D. H3 image lane + node-pack registry

| ID | Assumption | Verdict | Evidence | Decision it shapes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | GAP-1: `workflow.ts` emits Motion-Context classes (`MiniMaxH3MotionContext{,LoadLatent,SaveLatent,Trim}`) with no `ENGINE_NODE_PACKS` row | **VERIFIED — still open** — `src/lib/workflow.ts:241-286` emits exactly those four; the 9 registry rows contain no motion-context entry | In-repo reads at main `51b5326` | The two missing rows (registry doc correction #1) — detection/preflight still falls through for the chain lane |
| D-2 | GAP-2: `upscale.ts` emits LBH upscaler classes (`MinimaxH3LatentUpscalerNode2D/3D`) with no row, no pin, no provenance | **VERIFIED — still open** — `src/lib/graph/upscale.ts:10-34`; absent from the registry | Same | Same — plus the origin-repo pin the registry doc asks for |
| D-3 | `ENGINE_NODE_PACKS` = 9 rows (the registry doc's "current code truth") | **VERIFIED** — vdn-h3, lora-form-adapter, minimax-h3-turbo, h3-hybrid-loader, krea2-controlnet, h3-audio-t8, krea2edit, krea2-anypaint, autocontext | `src/lib/nodePackRegistry.ts:41-159` | The A-3 family-registry join (§8 of the registry doc) |
| D-4 | Klein lane BROKEN-UNTIL-FIXED at validation (CFGGuider misnamed inputs; `ImageScaleToTotalPixels` wants `resolution_steps`) | **VERIFIED — still unfixed** — `src/lib/graph/h3image.ts:969` still emits `conditioning`/`conditioning_1` on CFGGuider (engine wants `positive`/`negative`); the two divergences are ledgered in `src/lib/engineSemantics.ts:167-182` | In-repo reads | The klein refine lane remains un-runnable on a real engine until the fix task lands; do not schedule klein A/B benchmarks before it |
| D-5 | Kreatine supersession claims (license-clean `control_loader`, byte-vendored anypaint pair, notices kept) | **VERIFIED at file level** — `nodes/control_loader.py`, `core/anypaint.py`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` all present at `Kreatine/vendor/ComfyUI-Kreatine` | Directory reads, 2026-09-21. The behavioral claim ("loads the same weights") settles in the Krea lane's own test — UNVERIFIABLE-NOW, cheap test = the TS-1/registry-row testbed task | The CUT list (facok controlnet, ostris-edit, standalone anypaint) — holds as proposed |
| D-6 | astropuzzo Image Studio v23.0.0 (`47dea30`, 2026-09-12) is still latest; Unlicense | **VERIFIED** — GitHub releases/latest = v23.0.0, published 2026-09-12 | GitHub API, 2026-09-21 | The adoption task's pin stays valid |
| D-7 | The pack's "ComfyUI ≥0.30" floor vs our shared install 0.34.0 ✓ | **VERIFIED** (0.34.0 > 0.30; install version read directly) | `comfyui_version.py` | No blocker on the adoption path |

### E. UI toolbox (the ui-systems + fonts/icons captures)

| ID | Assumption | Verdict | Evidence | Decision it shapes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | `@base-ui/react` 1.8.0 installed = latest; exports ~50 component modules; only 2 used | **VERIFIED** — installed 1.8.0; npm latest 1.8.0; 49 module dirs in `node_modules/@base-ui/react/` | npm registry + node_modules listing, 2026-09-21 | The wave-3 wrapper-layer expansion (migration step 1) |
| E-2 | lucide-react 0.468.0 installed, 1.47.0 latest; bump pending with 8-name canonical sweep | **VERIFIED** — npm latest 1.47.0; installed 0.468.0 | npm + package.json | The cheap chore stands; nothing changed upstream since the pass |
| E-3 | dockview-react 8.3.1 latest (the DA-5 rack answer); react-rnd 10.5.3 installed-matches; neither dockview/tanstack-virtual/YARL installed yet (correctly — "no shelf-ware deps") | **VERIFIED** — npm latest 8.3.1; package.json has only base-ui/lucide/react-rnd of the interactive set | npm + package.json | Control Center spec can rely on dockview 8.3.x features (pinned tabs, floating groups, popouts) |
| E-4 | @dnd-kit/core "npm last published 2024-12-05 despite repo activity" (the staleness datum behind its rejection) | **VERIFIED exactly** — npm latest 6.3.1, published 2024-12-05, no newer version exists | npm registry time index | The rejection stands; re-trigger (Workbench cross-surface drag) unchanged |

### F. Licenses (the load-bearing surprises, re-verified)

| ID | Assumption | Verdict | Evidence | Decision it shapes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-1 | YuE2-3B weights = **CC-BY-NC-4.0**, ungated (breaks the m-a-p Apache lineage) | **VERIFIED** — HF API tag `license:cc-by-nc-4.0`, `gated: False` | HF model API, 2026-09-21 | The family row's non-commercial verdict; catalog consent posture |
| F-2 | Qwen-Image-2.1 = **Qwen Research License** (`license: other`, non-commercial), not Apache-2.0 | **VERIFIED** — HF API `license: other` (the full text was read in the assessment; license_name `qwen-research`) | HF model API, 2026-09-21 | The ADOPT verdict's gate; fetch-catalog license verdict rows |
| F-3 | Comfy-Org ships official int8-convrot DiT + TE (+W4A8) day-one for Qwen 2.1 (our quant class) | **VERIFIED** — file list: `qwen_image_2.1_int8_convrot.safetensors`, `qwen3vl_8b_int8_convrot.safetensors`, `qwen3vl_8b_w4a8.safetensors`, bf16 VAE | HF API siblings, 2026-09-21 | The ~17.3 GB resident-on-24GB plan for the family |
| F-4 | Music 3 = MiniMax Community License (commercial under $20M/yr) | **VERIFIED** — LICENSE file head "MiniMax Music3 COMMUNITY LICENSE" (HF tag unset — the file is the truth, not the tag) | Raw LICENSE fetch | music3 as the commercial-safe rung of the audio ladder |

### G. Remediation-plan §6 + direction-audit anchors (post-Wave-1/2 spot-check)

| ID | Assumption | Verdict | Evidence | Decision it shapes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G-1 | Job landing is still client-side today (A-1 server-side watcher not yet built) | **VERIFIED** — `src/hooks/useGenerationQueue.ts` is still the client history-poll loop; no server-side completion watcher exists | In-repo read at main `51b5326` | The binding constraint on the Control Center / Workbench spec rounds: A-1 must land first (as §6 already orders) |
| G-2 | "Full object_info is megabytes" (A-8's incremental-pull premise) | **CORROBORATED** — the engine-contract fixture records `rawClassCount: 1718` against a 151 KB trimmed 69-class capture; MB-class at full breadth. Cheap settling test: the next CPU-only capture records the raw JSON byte size in the provenance block (one-line script addition) | `scripts/fixtures/engine-object-info.json` provenance | A-8's targeted-probe design (landed in Wave 2) — premise holds |
| G-3 | better-sqlite3 + WAL single-writer stays (no Postgres) | **VERIFIED as built** — `server/db.ts` decision record 2026-09-11; `better-sqlite3@^13.0.3` | In-repo | A-7's worker-threading rule applies to the existing substrate only |
| G-4 | The plan's file:line anchors (R-01 `useStudioSession.ts:69-74`, `core.ts:194-215`, etc.) | **VERIFIED-as-moved, symbols intact** — Wave 1/2 landed: `checkConnection` now `useStudioSession.ts:117`; `structuralPromptError` refactored to `src/lib/promptError` (imported at `core.ts:27`); `validateH3Render` at `h3Submit.ts:117`; R-13's `''`-guard landed with its comment at `fetchCatalog.ts:81`; `instanceInventory.ts` is now fully registry-only (R-12 landed). The plan's own header disclaimer ("anchors at HEAD `7ee1e3c`; branches may have moved code") held exactly | In-repo reads vs plan §2 | None — disclaimed drift, recorded so nobody treats stale anchors as defects |
| G-5 | The registry-only inventory invariant (instance-invisible = nonexistent) is the built behavior | **VERIFIED** — `server/instanceInventory.ts` header: "there is no local scan, no local/instance merge, and no fallback" (Wave 2, PR #38) | In-repo read | The A-3 family registry builds on landed ground |

---

## 2. The version-pin recommendation (the policy this pass produces)

**Facts:** upstream tagged 3 releases in 15 days; two of our family gates quoted wrong/stale minimums within 48 hours of writing; the maintainer's runtime is master while our reference is 0.34.0; every captured semantic re-verified stable 0.34.0→master.

1. **The app's compatibility floor stays "≥ v0.34.0 semantics."** Verified stable through v0.37.0/master on every load-bearing surface (A-2). No code change is forced by upstream motion.
2. **The engine-contract fixture + devdocs captures re-capture per ADOPTED TAG, not per calendar.** Trigger: any task that adds or exercises engine classes the current fixture lacks (YuE2, Qwen-Image-2.1, and every future family). The capture script's regenerate header is the procedure; record the raw byte size while there (G-2).
3. **New-family rows carry a per-class `minComfyVersion`** in the family registry data (A-3 join), sourced from tag-level file checks (raw fetch), NEVER from docs.comfy.org version strings — this pass caught the docs site claiming 0.35.0 for nodes that ship in 0.36.0.
4. **The shared canonical install should bump to the latest TAG (today: v0.37.0), not to master**, when the audio/Qwen adoption tasks dispatch — tagged for reproducibility; coordinated with the maintainer (their instance, their GPU window). One bump unblocks both new families (YuE2 ≥0.36.0, cfg_scale + Qwen 2.1 at ≥0.37.0). Until then, engine-dependent tests for those families cannot run — plan them as graph-shape-only.

## 3. UNVERIFIABLE-NOW (with the settling test)

| Item | Cheap test that settles it |
|---|---|
| Manager 4.3 route-table diff (C-6) | Read `glob/manager_server.py` at tag 4.3; diff routes + `QueueTaskItem` vs the capture §1. ~30 min, no engine. Fire BEFORE the Manager-first install build. |
| Issue #15644 tracker state (any maintainer reply / PR since 2026-09-21 morning) | Fetch the issue page (API was rate-limited this pass). Informational only — the code-level floor is verified unchanged at master, which is the load-bearing half. |
| Full raw object_info byte size (G-2) | One line in `capture-engine-schemas.cjs`: record the raw JSON's byte count into `__provenance`. Lands with the next re-capture. |
| Kreatine `control_loader` behavioral parity (D-5) | The Krea lane's own testbed A/B (already the TS-1/registry-row plan); file-level license-cleanliness is verified. |
| The 8188 instance's exact current revision (A-5) | Ask the maintainer (never probe 8188). Only matters if a captured symptom fails to reproduce on the shared install. |

## 4. Recurrence

Re-run this register: **(1)** after any major research landing (a new assessment that embeds engine/version/license facts), **(2)** before each spec round (Control Center, Workbench), **(3)** on any self-caught wrong claim. Each re-run appends a dated pass section below — rows are never silently rewritten; superseded rows get a verdict update with the new evidence line.

### Pass 1 record (2026-09-21)

- Swept: remediation-plan §1–§6, both devdocs captures + MANIFEST, 7 research assessments, the epic directives' embedded facts, ROADMAP + LEARNINGS headlines. 24 rows registered.
- Corrected in-pass: `docs/devdocs/comfyui-api/index.md` (version-drift addendum incl. the YuE2 minimum), `docs/research/qwen-image-2.1-assessment.md` (v0.37.0 trigger fired), `docs/devdocs/MANIFEST.md` (last-verified bump for the comfyui-api row).
- Relayed, not patched (owned file): the YuE2 v0.36.0 minimum — `docs/research/yue2-3b-assessment.md` is in-flight-owned; the devdocs addendum carries the fact with a pointer.
- No corrections found in: ui-systems-design-language, shibui-fonts-icons, node-pack-registry, h3-image-studio-pack, crossview-warp, remediation-plan, ROADMAP, LEARNINGS (their claims verified as recorded).

# Pass 2 (2026-09-26) — the 09-25/26 landings + the Viggle gate lesson

> Round 2 of the same directive (`6a857386`). Scope: the 2026-09-25/26 research landings — [viggle-assessment.md](../research/viggle-assessment.md), [h3-v2v-reanchor.md](../research/h3-v2v-reanchor.md), [h3-overlap-concept.md](../research/h3-overlap-concept.md) (+ its Addendum 3), [fizgig-h3-still-assessment.md](../research/fizgig-h3-still-assessment.md), the [reality-audit-2026-09-25.md](reality-audit-2026-09-25.md) environment-mirror — plus the institutional lesson from the Viggle gate. Method unchanged: primary sources only — the shared install `/home/agent/comfyui` (read-only code reads), the HF API (file lists + sizes via `?blobs=true`), GitHub API/raw at pinned AND current revisions, the docs.comfy.org changelog; no GPU, no engine, no installs. Same verdict vocabulary as pass 1.

## P2.0 Headline

**15 rows: 13 VERIFIED, 0 CORRECTED, 1 UNVERIFIABLE-BY-NATURE restated honestly (Fizgig's dB number — status unchanged), 1 ecosystem gap found UNDER a still-true claim** (sparse attention: the weights claim holds today, but ComfyUI core shipped H3-specific block-sparse kernels five days before the transitions doc compiled — dated addendum landed). Every load-bearing claim in the week's landings verifies against primary sources, most line-exact or byte-exact. The pass's structural output is the **ecosystem-scan rule** (§P2.6, the Viggle gate lesson institutionalized), and its spot-application found the same miss-shape twice more under still-true claims (the sparse-attention node; the VideoX-Fun motion).

## P2.1 The Viggle gate, re-verified TODAY (2026-09-26)

| ID | Claim (viggle-assessment §1) | Verdict | Evidence (fetched 2026-09-26) |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-1 | drbaph quants exist at the stated repo/sizes: int8_convrot **47.03 GB**, pruned-int8 **21.03 GB**, r64 LoRA **0.94 GB**, `fixed_embed_fwd_anyframe` present | **VERIFIED — byte-exact** | HF API `drbaph/Viggle-Animate-ComfyUI?blobs=true`: 47.03 / 21.03 / 0.94 GB (+ 3.77 GB full-rank LoRA); `text_cond/fixed_embed_fwd_anyframe.safetensors` present; repo lastModified still **2026-09-07** (nothing moved since the 09-25 read); 76.3k downloads (noise per doctrine). Also present: a 66.28 GB bf16 conversion — there at read time, unitemized then; no recorded claim affected |
| P2-2 | The official Viggle repo ships bf16 only (no official quant) | **VERIFIED** | `Viggle/Viggle-Animate` file tree: 14 transformer shards (~66 GB class) + 2.67 GB LoRA; zero quantized transformer files |
| P2-3 | Animate v2 status: "training a substantially better model right now" — no v2 release | **VERIFIED — card unchanged** | Repo sha still `9cd946f` (lastMod 2026-09-18); README line 247 verbatim today |
| P2-4 | Meridian's geometry dependency is FAIR-NC (any commercial posture gated on a VGGT-Omega replacement) | **VERIFIED** | `facebookresearch/vggt-omega` LICENSE re-fetched: "FAIR Noncommercial Research License v1"; `Viggle/Meridian` sha still `9c57d46` (lastMod 09-19) |

## P2.2 The V2V re-anchor three (h3-v2v-reanchor.md, verified against the shared-install code)

| ID | Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-5 | **Silent truncation**: the reference video is truncated to target length (`frames = frames[:frame_count]`, cited at `nodes_minimax_h3.py:323-324`) | **VERIFIED — line-exact** | `comfy_extras/nodes_minimax_h3.py:323-324` verbatim at v0.34.0. The surrounding half verifies too: <5 frames raises; then `while n % 17 != 5: n -= 1` snaps DOWN to the 17k+5 grid — the doc's "silently truncates … then snaps down" sequence is exactly the code's order |
| P2-6 | The **5–15 s envelope** (target tooltip "trained range is ~124-362"; ref-video tooltip "2-15s") | **VERIFIED — line-exact** | `:264` length tooltip "(124 = ~5s, trained range is ~124-362)"; `:273` ref_video tooltip "Reference video frames at 24 fps (2-15s)" |
| P2-7 | **`visual_cond_noise_aug` is the real, unexposed conditioning-strength dial** (default 0.999; `<1.0` mixes seeded noise into the never-denoised cond rows) | **VERIFIED** | `comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:32` `VISUAL_COND_TIMESTEP = 0.999`; `_cond_video_rows` reads `payload.get("visual_cond_noise_aug", …)` at `:528`, mixes `aug*r + (1-aug)*noise` when `< 1.0` (the cited 525-538 span is the function). Payload-settable ⇒ surfaceable by the graph factory, as the doc claims. Note the unnamed twin: `audio_cond_noise_aug` / `AUDIO_COND_TIMESTEP = 1.0` (`:33`, `:542`) — a second free dial for the O-soft/audio arms |

## P2.3 The overlap corrections chain (h3-overlap-concept.md + Addendum 3)

| ID | Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-8 | The **90 f window is a VRAM choice, not an architecture limit** (pack source documented to 643 frames; 12 GB at ~0.5 MP; window configurable; nothing in the model privileges 90) | **VERIFIED** | README at pinned `e2f2bc6` — **still HEAD, zero new commits**: §Tested Configuration lists 12 GB VRAM · 90-frame processing windows · 8-frame overlap · 82-frame source batches · portrait+landscape · "Videos up to 643 frames" · "**Approximately 0.5-megapixel processing resolution**" (the other "~1-megapixel" string in the README is the OPTIONAL final output after upscaling — no conflict with "0.5 MP processing"). "Configurable processing-window size" = the configurability half |
| P2-9 | **Audio grid hostility**: `audio_steps = frames × 5/3`, whole only for frames ≡ 0 (mod 3); 8 f → 13.33 (off-grid, the tick condition); 39 f → 65 (phase-exact) | **VERIFIED — code constants** | `nodes_minimax_h3.py:32-33` `FPS = 24`, `AUDIO_LATENT_FPS = 40`; `temporal_shape` `:49` returns `round(duration × 40)` = frames×5/3 exactly; integer iff 3 divides frames |
| P2-10 | **Addendum 3 stands** (the workflow's 0.59 is `target_megapixels`, not ref-strength; the ostris node has no strength input at all) | **VERIFIED — still current** | `ostris/ComfyUI-AIToolkit-MiniMaxH3` is still a single Initial commit (`4bf42cd`, 2026-08-20); schema at HEAD: `video / target_megapixels 0.01–4.0 (default 0.258) / max_length` — no strength input; 0.59 is a legal megapixel value |

## P2.4 The Fizgig-H3-Still headline number

| ID | Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-11 | Round-trip **29.99 vs 16.96 dB** (group-replicate vs lone token), recorded as "precisely cited, script not shipped — not independently runnable" | **UNVERIFIABLE — status honestly UNCHANGED: author-cited-unverifiable** | Trainer `shootthesound/Fizgig` at HEAD (pushed 2026-09-25T23:06Z): still **no `tests/`, no diag script** (289-file tree scanned 2026-09-26). The PACK moved — 3 commits 2026-09-26T00:24–00:30Z (`c6a1d69` an 8 MP no-Turbo example workflow + sample still; `54eaa31`/`10d5171` README recommended-sizes + decode wording; registry version still 1.0.0) — **demo artifacts, not measurement artifacts**. Dated addendum landed in the assessment; E-FS0 remains the settling test |

## P2.5 The environment mirror's fidelity

| ID | Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-12 | `e2e/mirror/profiles/maintainer-instance.json` shapes like the maintainer's real instance (evidence spanning the 09-22 PreviewOverride exam + 4B-TE crash log through the 09-25 assembly session: five foreign packs, subpath'd models, the 4B-trap TE, taeh3 previews) | **VERIFIED as of its 09-25 assembly — now UNVERIFIED-SINCE-09-25, gaps named** | No direct observation of 8188 since 09-25 (policy — never probed). Post-assembly evidence all CONSISTENT with the profile: the 09-26 DAV finding ("their engine serves no DAV at all" = the profile's VAE listing) and the 09-26 TE-dimension doc (the 4B-trap file present = the profile's TE listing). Standing gaps (mostly the registry addendum §11's own caveats): their lora-manager revision unrecorded (our `77109b3c` pin is the Kreatine vendor copy); one-node byte-identity unconfirmed (AIFSH-fork identification); the five-dir pack inventory is session evidence, not an `ls` (§11.7's UNEXAMINED-NEXT list is the likely residue); foreign class names in the profile are approximations (real multishot names `H3MultishotSampler` et al.); `comfyui_version: v0.34.0` is OUR floor, not their truth (their instance runs master — pass 1 A-5). Dated refresh note landed in the reality audit; the JSON itself untouched (test fixture; docs-only pass) |

## P2.6 The ecosystem-scan rule (the Viggle gate lesson, institutionalized)

**The lesson:** our 09-14 "no int8 convrot shipped" record was 8 days stale in the wrong direction — drbaph shipped 09-05, and we read the model card but never scanned the ecosystem. This pass's spot-application found the same miss-shape twice more (§P2.7's sparse-attention and VideoX-Fun rows): claims that stayed formally true while the ecosystem moved under them.

**THE RULE:**

> Any claim of the form **"X is not available / none shipped / not yet in Y / no community Z"** is only recordable **with an ecosystem-scope check attached**, and re-verifies on every curation pass. Minimum check scope: **(1)** community quant/conversion repos — the HF orgs of the family's known converters (drbaph, Kijai, Abiray-class) plus an HF search on the model name; **(2)** the ComfyUI surface — the docs.comfy.org changelog since the last check + the ComfyUI-Manager index; **(3)** the upstream repo's own file tree **and open PRs** (a half-shipped state is recorded as "closer", not ignored); **(4)** the top pack authors' recent releases for the family. Every negative claim carries its check's **sources + date** — "checked where" is part of the claim's provenance. **Re-verify triggers:** every assumption-register pass, every registry quarterly re-run, and before any decision that consumes the claim as a gate.

**Placement:** (a) **landed** — the node-pack-registry §10 recurrence table (the negative-availability trigger row, added 2026-09-26) and this register's recurrence practice (amended §P2.9); (b) **proposed for the maintainer to ratify** — a one-paragraph addendum to directive `6a857386` on epic 4lphxv8 carrying the rule text above, so the discipline is pinned where the ratify charter lives.

**Scope note:** the rule covers AVAILABILITY claims ("none shipped"), not UNMEASURED-CELL claims ("nobody has published X measurement") — the latter are re-settled by our own test suites (the E-series/VG-series arms), not by ecosystem scans.

## P2.7 The live "not available" claims re-checked TODAY (the spot-application table)

Sweep patterns: `none shipped · not yet · no community · gated on · not available · unreleased · not released · not in · no quant · nobody has`.

| Claim (doc) | Ecosystem check 2026-09-26 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Viggle gate "no int8 convrot shipped" → corrected 09-25 (viggle-assessment) | drbaph repo unchanged since 09-07; files byte-verified (P2-1) | **VERIFIED open** |
| `Saganaki22/ComfyUI-Viggle-Animate-H3` 404 (viggle-assessment §1) | GitHub repo + API: still 404 today | **VERIFIED still-true** |
| MiniMax sparse-attention **weights** "not yet released" (h3-transitions §5, compiled 09-14) | HF `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3` unchanged since 08-13 — no sparse files; zero changelog mentions through v0.37.2 — **the weights claim holds**. But core shipped **`BlockSparseAttention`** (`comfy_extras/nodes_sparse_attention.py`) in **v0.35.0, tagged 09-09 — five days BEFORE the doc compiled**: block-sparse attention on `comfy_kitchen` kernels (Sol-Attn adaptive threshold, SLA-style top-k, FastVideo VSA) with an **H3-specific chunked-qkv block-patch path** (the file imports `MiniMaxH3Model`; changelog: "Model Sparse Attention node for comfy-kitchen sparse backends"). Absent at our v0.34.0 pin, present v0.35.0→master | **Weights: VERIFIED. Framing: GAP → dated addendum landed in h3-transitions** — training-free sparse attention for H3 is in core today; the long-sequence compute lever does not wait on MiniMax's weights |
| "Full technical report promised but not yet published" (h3-transitions §5) | No report in the repo; none surfaced in this pass's searches | **VERIFIED still-true** |
| "VDN is not core, and there is no PR making it core" (speed-quality §1.x, checked through v0.35.1) | docs.comfy.org changelog through **v0.37.2 (09-23)**: zero VDN mentions | **VERIFIED — window extended to v0.37.2** |
| "GLM 5.3 Flash = not yet in llama.cpp (issue #27922)" (video-dataset-prep-tools §) | llama.cpp master `llama-arch.cpp`: chatglm / glm4 / glm4moe / glm-dsa — **no glm5next**; PR #27773 "add GLM-5.3-Flash (GLM5-Next) support" (opened 08-26) **open and unmerged**, with open CUDA-bug issues filed against that branch; #27922 still open | **VERIFIED still-true, precision note**: an implementation exists as an unmerged third-party PR — record "closer than not-yet", not flipped |
| Fizgig diag script not public (fizgig-h3-still §2) | P2-11 | **VERIFIED still-true** |
| VideoX-Fun "the trainer has no quantized-weight training path; training rides the bf16 full checkpoint" (ap10k §1.2) | `scripts/minimax_h3/README_TRAIN.md` at HEAD `67e3b4b` (09-24): bf16 mixed precision only; the qfloat8 modes are inference-side | **VERIFIED still-true at HEAD** — but the repo moved past the doc's pin (`968f0e2`, 09-04): commit `2beb171` (09-22) "Support new Control for Minimax-H3". **Recheck trigger:** re-verify the AP-10K hot-start and verdict before that build dispatches |

## P2.8 Corrections landed this pass (dated addenda, never silent)

- `docs/research/h3-transitions-and-latent-continuity.md` — addendum: sparse-attention weights still unreleased (verified 09-26) + the core `BlockSparseAttention` node the 09-14 compile missed.
- `docs/research/fizgig-h3-still-assessment.md` — addendum: the 09-26 commits (demo artifacts only), the dB number's status restated.
- `docs/audit/reality-audit-2026-09-25.md` — the mirror profile's dated refresh note (evidence vintage, UNVERIFIED-SINCE gaps, refresh procedure).
- `docs/research/node-pack-registry.md` — §10 recurrence table: the negative-availability / ecosystem-scope trigger row.

No claim in the week's landings was CORRECTED — every addendum above adds ecosystem context or currency, it does not reverse a recorded claim.

## P2.9 Recurrence amendment

Amending pass 1's §4 recurrence (append-only, the original text stands above): every re-run of this register additionally re-verifies all recorded **negative-availability claims** per the ecosystem-scan rule (§P2.6), with the checks' sources and dates recorded in the pass section.

### Pass 2 record (2026-09-26)

- Swept: the five 09-25/26 landings' load-bearing claims + the live "not available" claims across `docs/research` (the §P2.7 patterns).
- 15 rows: 13 VERIFIED, 0 CORRECTED, 1 UNVERIFIABLE-BY-NATURE (restated), 1 framing gap (addendum landed).
- Structural output: the ecosystem-scan rule — landed in two homes (this register, node-pack-registry §10), proposed as an addendum to directive `6a857386` for the maintainer to ratify.
- Flux task: tx0omjr.

## Dated confirmation line (2026-09-28 — the vlo + scumble fold-in; interim to pass 3, not a pass)

Two multi-source confirmations from the 09-28 sibling assessments
([vlo-assessment.md](../research/vlo-assessment.md) read at `fc4d241`,
[scumble-assessment.md](../research/scumble-assessment.md) read at
`76fbae1`) join the register's discipline between passes — recorded here so
pass 3 inherits them as rows:

| ID | The confirmed fact | The multi-source trail |
|---|---|---|
| IC-1 | **Qwen-Image-2.1 `<imageN>` tag addressing is the official multi-image protocol** — now three independent sources deep, up from the single measured sighting | (1) **Measured:** [fooocus-qwen-assessment.md](../research/fooocus-qwen-assessment.md) §3 (the ogoun shell — the operating doctrine our spec's `promptContract` row rides); (2) **Official:** the family record's 2026-09-27 [CORRECT] in [qwen-image-2.1-assessment.md](../research/qwen-image-2.1-assessment.md); (3) **Production:** scumble's `qwen_image_edit_2_1_local` recipe routes the crop as `<image1>` and reference pictures as `<image2>`/`<image3>` with `ImageFromBatch` splitting — a third shop shipping the scheme [DOC]. The spec's promptContract provenance is multi-source; no load-bearing claim moves. |
| IC-2 | **The H3 visible-frame grid is 17k+5 (5, 22, 39 … 719)** — independent production corroboration of our one grid authority (`h3AlignFrameCount`, `src/lib/workflow.ts`) | Line-exact from ComfyUI core (pass 2, P2-5: `while n % 17 != 5: n -= 1` at v0.34.0) **+** vlo's shipped H3 sidecars encode the grid as min 5 / max 719 / step 17 / default 124, with the timeline frame-picker snapping selections to `frame_step * n + frame_offset` so users cannot request an invalid count — third-party production use including the picker-snapping UX we lack [DOC]. |
