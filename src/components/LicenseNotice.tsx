/** One-time, dismissible notice for the MiniMax H3 community license: region
 *  restrictions reported by the community and the commercial-use requirement.
 *  Shown until acknowledged; the acknowledgement is per-browser. Renders in
 *  the first paint (synchronous localStorage read) so downstream one-shot
 *  layout measurements already account for it.
 *
 *  FIXME(wiring): this component is never rendered — zero importers (the
 *  "LicenseNotice precedent" mention in FirstRunNotice is a comment, not an
 *  import; the notice it lingers from is gone). Tracked in
 *  docs/audit/wiring-check-2026-09-26.md §4. */

        MiniMax H3 weights carry MiniMax&apos;s community license. Community reporting says it excludes the EU, UK, South Korea, and the United States, and that local commercial use requires a MiniMax license sold through Comfy. Generated outputs follow the same terms. Verify the current license for your region on the MiniMax model card before publishing or selling work.
