/** H3 image workbench graph families (task k9vu6t0, spec
 * docs/specs/image-workbench-v1.md r2) — the image surface of the studio on
 * MiniMax H3: generate (frame-packet + T=1 Fast), compose (9 ordered refs),
 * the six edit families, refine engines (Krea 2 / klein), the burst lane
 * (app-side fuse + the E-IW2-gated SeedVR2 arm), and the start-frame exit.
 *
 * Built in the KREA2_EDIT_FAMILIES style (a sibling family registry —
 * n1 of the spec audit: NOT optimization-registry transforms): a family is
 * data — id, recipe pins, dials, detect(), ui guidance — and every builder is
 * a deterministic pure function over plain JSON graphs. Two contracts carry
 * over:
 *
 *  1. DETERMINISM — graphs serialize canonically (stable string ids, one
 *     node per id, inputs in declared order) so golden snapshots are the
 *     build contract (scripts/fixtures/h3img-golden.json).
 *  2. THE MAMAD8 FACTORY GUARD (spec AC8, enforced not documented): the T=1
 *     image VAE materially regresses multi-frame video decode (patch-grid
 *     ghosting, cross-frame mixing — Mamad8's own card). It is legal ONLY
 *     in single-frame graphs; any video-frame-count graph referencing it is
 *     a factory validation error (assertNoT1ImageVaeInVideoGraph, wired
 *     into buildMiniMaxWorkflow AND h3imgGraphAudit).
 *
 * Research pins: docs/research/h3-image-workbench.md (+ its §7.2 family
 * list), h3-instruction-based-editing.md §4 (the two paths, the T=1 recipe),
 * burst-frame-enhancement.md (the fuse lane, 4n+1), krea2-edit-mode.md (the
 * refine default), the official ComfyUI klein image-edit template (rev
 * installed with ComfyUI 0.34-era — template-faithful port), and the
 * scottmudge MiniMaxH3HybridLoader node read from the canonical shared
 * install (block_range_adaln 25..49 = the b25-49 hybrid).
 *
 * THE PACK ADOPTION (task afvlbk4, maintainer ruling 2026-09-22 "adopt the
 * pack for now, port later"): when the H3 Image Studio pack's Prepare
 * classes are served, this builder routes its conditioning + decode through
 * the pack's four load-bearing classes — legal latent_t=1 (the T=1 Fast
 * lane's whole existence), the EXACT 9/13 packet ladder (no 22-frame snap),
 * and the single-latent-slice decode (the fast-sharp profile: image-VAE
 * sharpness over multi-frame sampling context). The model chain, recipe
 * pins, prompt contracts, audits, and the scorer stay OURS — the pack's
 * sampler/resolution/selector nodes duplicate capability this app already
 * owns and are never emitted (assessment §4). Pack absent → packets keep
 * the stock path (5/39 native; 9/13 honestly labeled as the 22-frame snap)
 * while T=1/fast-sharp REFUSE (the stock length:1 path is dead — no code
 * path submits it anymore; the engine-contract divergence h3img.t1-length-1
 * retired with it).
 *
 * THE E-FS1 FIZGIG ARM (task 464xfvd, behind a flag — the Fizgig-H3-Still
 * challenge, docs/research/fizgig-h3-still-assessment.md): the settings
 * flag `experimentalT1Decode` ('image-studio' default = zero behavior
 * change) can select 'fizgig', routing the T=1 leg through the 94-line
 * pack's two classes — the STOCK conditioning node stays in the graph for
 * its conditioning (latent output dangling, length widget legal at 5 — the
 * #15644 floor sidestepped from the submission side), FizgigH3StillLatent
 * builds the T=1 packed latent, and FizgigH3StillDecode replicates it into
 * a 5-latent temporal group decoded through the VIDEO VAE keeping pixel
 * frame 3 — no Mamad8 loader anywhere on that leg. Classes unserved → the
 * honest refusal naming the pack. The E-FS0/E-FS1 bake-off owns the
 * verdict; until it reports, the Image Studio path is the default and the
 * flag is never set by the app.
