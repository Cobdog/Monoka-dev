/** Model overrides — the explicit-pick layer OVER the selection-inference
 *  ladder (task euxwdva).
 *
 * Every engine family resolves its models by inferring them from the
 * instance registry (src/lib/modelSelection.ts's shared ladder, h3image's
 * inferH3ImgSelection, music3/ace's own). That ladder can only find files
 * whose names match a known pattern — a community merge (TenStrip
 * 10Eros-Max beta5 int8, say) matches nothing and is therefore invisible
 * to generation, no matter that the engine serves it. This module is the
 * ONE seam where an explicit user pick beats inference:
 *
 *   resolveModels(family, inferredSelection, registry, overrides)
 *
 * RESOLUTION ORDER (the contract every surface documents): chain-level
 * override > global (Settings) override > auto (inference). An absent or
 * empty slot is auto — nothing changes for existing users.
 *
 * Picks are REGISTRY-ANCHORED (Wave 2 R-12 — directive 2987ef3e): a slot's
 * value must be the EXACT registry-listed name of a file the CONNECTED
 * instance serves (matched case-insensitively, then canonicalized to the
 * registry row's real name so a case-drifted pick never loads a name the
 * engine would reject). Instance-invisible = nonexistent — a pick the
 * registry does not list never reaches a graph. Three outcomes per slot:
 *
 *   applied  — the registry row becomes the slot's selection
 *   degraded — the file vanished from the registry since the pick was set
 *              (the engine restarted without it, a folder moved): fall back
 *              to auto WITH a visible warning (environmental drift, not a
 *              user error — the render may proceed)
 *   refused  — the instance serves the file but the family cannot use it
 *              (wrong kind, the T=1 image VAE pushed into the video
 *              family, or a slot the family does not expose): the
 *              submission REFUSES with the reason — never a doomed graph
 *
 * Quant variants (int8 / nvfp4 / fp8 / fp16) are filename-level cuts of the
 * same architecture; the machine-checkable expectation in registry data is
 * the KIND alone. The registry lists filenames only — no header reads, so
 * no form/quant verification happens app-side (the scan-time h3Form gate
 * died with the local scan, Wave 2): the ENGINE is the final arbiter — it
 * loads the file or fails loudly, and the failure taxonomy surfaces that
 * readably. A wrong-quant pick is not refusable here and is deliberately
 * not guessed at.
 *
 * The H3 families expose THREE checkpoint-class slots (rq0lsax): fl2va (the
 * first-frame/I2V lane), ref2va (the reference lane), and merged (ONE
 * pre-merged checkpoint standing in for both — the runtime-merge machinery
 * exists precisely so nobody HAS to pre-merge, but a community merge the
 * engine serves is the merge slot's reason to exist). When the merged pick
 * applies it is
 * THE checkpoint — it fills both lanes, and simultaneously-set lane picks
 * get an explicit superseded warning (never a silent drop). The pre-split
 * single 'checkpoint' pick migrates onto fl2va AND ref2va (see
 * migrateLegacyModelOverrideSlots).
 *
 * The VAE slots split by DECODER CLASS (task epdvxd4): videoVae, audioVae,
 * and imageVae (the Mamad8 T=1 decoder) replace the old single 'vae' pick.
 * The graphs load DISTINCT decoders — the H3 video/workbench graphs carry a
 * video VAELoader (node 3) AND an audio VAELoader (node 4), the T=1 Fast
 * profile decodes through its own image VAE, and the audio-only engines'
 * (music3) one VAE is audio-class — so a single 'vae' entry could
 * reach only ever one of them.
 * Slot legality is per family (IMAGE_VAE_FAMILIES): the imageVae pick
 * exists only where a single-frame graph can legally consume it; the video
 * family refuses it outright (every video graph is multi-frame — the
 * factory-level Mamad8 ban). Cross-class picks refuse at the seam (the
 * marker heuristics at VIDEO_VAE_MARKER document their own limits).
