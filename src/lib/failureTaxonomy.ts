/**
 * Failure taxonomy: maps a structural failure reason (node id/class + the
 * SANITIZED exception text that already passed through logSanitize) to a
 * human cause bucket. The doctrine is "we care that it failed on a node
 * because of a comma — not what they asked for"; this module adds the last
 * mile: which KNOWN cause class that node/reason pair belongs to, so the
 * Queue and the diagnostic report can say "GPU memory exhausted — see the
 * VRAM tier guidance", not just a traceback.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free by design (loads in the repo's VM-transpiled
 * unit-test harness). Matching is case-insensitive over the structural
 * fragments the sanitizer keeps (class names, error kinds, numbers) — never
 * over free-form prose, which is already [redacted] by the time it arrives.
