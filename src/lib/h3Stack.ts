/** The H3 stack report — DERIVED, never parallel (maintainer ruling
 *  2026-09-26: "the auto inferred models are there, the H3 Engine Stack
 *  reports are incorrect").
 *
 *  This module once carried its own expectation table — hardcoded expected
 *  filenames plus anchored fallback regexes per slot — a SECOND source of
 *  truth beside the inference ladders. The pickers resolved the
 *  maintainer's real files (substring + size-class anchors) while the
 *  table's regexes demanded tokens the ladders never require (the
 *  `_minimax_h3_` infix), so present models read MISSING while the UI
 *  showed them inferred. PR #52's basename fix addressed the comparison;
 *  the root was the parallel table itself. The report now resolves every
 *  slot through the SAME code path submit uses — inferSelections' ladders
 *  + the override seam (resolveModels) — and states, per row: the RESOLVED
 *  model (what the graph will load, registry name verbatim), its source
 *  layer (override/global/inferred), presence truth, and — display
 *  guidance ONLY — the canonical official artifact. A slot with no
 *  resolution reads as the honest empty state with inference-shaped
 *  guidance, never missing-because-unlisted; a found-but-refused pick (or
 *  a resolved TE of the wrong dimension class) narrates the existing
 *  refusal machinery's reason and blocks readiness, exactly like the
 *  submission would. */

 *  (R-29, audit C F7) With an object_info snapshot at hand the report also
 *  checks the ENGINE side: an instance a version behind serves every file
 *  check yet fails at render. `nodes.missing` names the h3-video core
 *  classes the engine does not serve, and `ready` is false while any are

/** (R2, central-model audit) THE ONE stack-ready predicate — the membership
 *  definition of "this H3 render can run," parameterized by what is actually
 *  being gated, so every surface (the submit gates' modelReady, the canvas
 *  chip, the diagnostics pair, and this report's own `ready`) derives from
 *  one rule instead of re-encoding membership per file:
 *
 *  - `mode` — which lane the gated graph loads. The video factory's
 *    UNETLoader picks ref2va ONLY in reference mode, fl2va otherwise, so the
 *    text/image/frames lanes do not require ref2va (a text-only stack is a
 *    READY stack — the old chip's blanket ref2va demand soft-gated
 *    first-frame renders the graph could actually run) and the reference
 *    lane does. The shared spine (textEncoder, videoVae, audioVae) is always
 *    required.
 *  - `turbo` — a turbo plan additionally requires ITS LANE's LoRA: the
 *    graph runs the tier's step count, and N distilled steps without the
 *    distillation LoRA is a broken render the old gates waved through.
 *  - `info` — render readiness: with an object_info snapshot at hand, the
 *    engine must serve the H3 core node classes (R-29: weights cannot fix a
 *    node class). No snapshot keeps the file-only verdict — the connection
 *    rung owns that refusal.
 *
 *  Refusal NARRATION stays with the narrators (the report's rows, the submit
 *  ladder's named messages); this predicate owns membership and nothing
 *  else. */
