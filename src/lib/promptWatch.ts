/**
 * Shared polling kernel for watching a ComfyUI prompt to completion.
 *
 * FIXME(wiring): this kernel is unwired — no live importer anywhere in src/
 * or server/ (the submit paths keep their own poll loops; only
 * tests/workflows.test.js loads this standalone). Tracked in
 * docs/audit/wiring-check-2026-09-26.md §1.
 *
 * Every caller-supplied `tick` does one poll round and returns:
 *   true  — the watch is finished (success or a terminal error the tick
 *           already surfaced); stop polling
 *   false — still rendering; poll again after intervalMs
 * A tick that THROWS counts as a failed round: transient failures are
 * retried, and only `tolerance` consecutive failures (or the wall-clock
 * deadline) exhaust the watch with a single clear message.
 *
 * This replaces the previous per-workspace loops, which failed in opposite
 * directions: one transient network error killed still-running watches,
 * while other loops swallowed errors forever with no deadline.
