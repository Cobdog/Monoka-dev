/**
 * The realtime fabric's recovery decisions as pure data (remediation Wave 1,
 * R-07 + R-08 — audit B P1-3 / P1-4). src/lib/useRealtime.ts owns the
 * sockets; these are the judgments, unit-testable without a server:
 *
 *   R-07 — SSE demotion is a FALLBACK, not a sentence: while demoted, a
 *   periodic WS re-probe (plus one on tab-visibility) tries the upgrade
 *   again, so an SSE-demoted session heals to WS (and LLM streaming with
 *   it) instead of losing it for the whole session.
 *
 *   R-08 — events missed DURING a reconnect are invisible to the seq-gap
 *   detector (the server restarts its per-client seq at 1): after a reopen
 *   every subscribed channel gets a synthetic resync so consumers
 *   re-fetch authoritative state — the reconnect window stops being the
 *   one drop window the fabric cannot see.
