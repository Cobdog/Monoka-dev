/**
 * THE SEMANTIC-RULES LEDGER (task 8dga2dy) — the engine's REINTERPRETATION
 * rules as committed data, plus the known-divergence registry. Schema
 * validation (engineContract.ts) catches what the engine REFUSES; this
 * ledger catches what the engine ACCEPTS BUT REINTERPRETS — the failure
 * class where "frame counts we say are the frame counts rendered" quietly
 * stops being true.
 *
 * Every rule here is verified against the pinned revision (a87667f,
 * v0.34.0 — source-read of comfy_extras/nodes_minimax_h3.py:46-48 and the
 * served object_info; see docs/devdocs/comfyui-api/index.md §ADDENDUM) and
 * carries its evidence source. Divergences are the honest-negative-results
 * artifact (the pack-author discipline): our builders' emissions the engine
 * does not honor as intended are PUBLISHED here — dated, owned, exact-match
 * enforced by tests/engine-contract.test.js — so the set can never grow
 * silently and every fix shrinks it audibly.
