 * Vision-capture scenarios — CAPTURE ONLY, no judgment here.

 * one or more CHECKPOINTS. A checkpoint pairs a screenshot moment with a
 * RUBRIC: the written contract a vision judge (see scripts/vision-e2e/JUDGE.md)
 * verifies the captured PNG against. Rubrics are DATA — they are copied
 * verbatim into the bundle's manifest.json, so a bundle is fully
 * self-describing: image + expected contract, in one directory.
 *
 * Rubric discipline:
 *  - Encode the CURRENT intended design only — every clause below was
 *    verified against a real capture of the live UI at 1920x1080.
 *  - State what must be present AND explicitly bless the intended design
 *    choices a generic "defect hunt" would misread (dimmed disabled
 *    controls offline, dense muted sub-labels, ellipsized status tiles) so
 *    the judge does not flag the design language as bugs.
 *  - Never claim dynamic content you cannot control (engine/LLM state,
 *    harvested community prompts, persisted counts).
 *
 * Adding a scenario: append here, then `pnpm test:vision` (capture) → judge
 * → `pnpm vision:report`. Nothing else to wire.
