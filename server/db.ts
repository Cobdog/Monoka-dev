/**
 * The studio database (wave 1 storage substrate): a single better-sqlite3
 * file at <MINIMAX_STUDIO_HOME>/studio.db.
 *
 * Decision record (2026-09-11): better-sqlite3 over node:sqlite because FTS5
 * is required for prompt search and node:sqlite is still RC without FTS5.
 * The database is the app's own LOCAL USER DATA: prompts are stored raw and
 * searchable (FTS needs them) — log-PII scrubbing applies to LOGS and
 * exported diagnostics, never to the user's own database. Media files stay
 * on the filesystem; this file holds metadata only.
 *
 * Migration discipline (the Wan2GP versioned-migration pattern): migrations
 * are an append-only numbered list; each one records a row in
 * schema_migrations inside the same transaction as its DDL, and PRAGMA
 * user_version is stamped with the latest id. Persisted records survive app
 * upgrades unchanged — a code upgrade only ever APPENDS migrations, and a
 * persisted history that no longer matches a prefix of the list is a hard
 * error rather than a silent re-shape.
